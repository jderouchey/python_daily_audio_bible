# python_daily_audio_bible
 A python 3.5  way of worshiping our lord.
 I wrote this on my windows 8.1 laptop.
 I have a raspberry pi in the masterbedroom, that I transfered the files
 I plan on setting up a cron job to launch every morning to wake me up so the scriptures are the first thing I hear in the day
 I will keep this updated as to what I do, and how I do it and the launch date it happens.  As I work on this script, I want to add more features, Like interactive prompts to save the files. Again, I am reading a book on python, so I am trying to get as much experience writing as I can.  
https://www.python.org/downloads/ is the website where you download python
http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Python-Edition-Mark-Lutz/dp/1449355730 Learning Python 5th Edition is what I am reading.
I am on page 72 as of December 10, 2015.
