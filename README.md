# python_daily_audio_bible
# A python 3.5  way of worshiping our lord
# I wrote this on my windows 8.1 laptop
# I have a raspberry pi in the masterbedroom, that I transfered the files
# I plan on setting up a cron job to launch every morning to wake me up
# so the scriptures are the first thing I hear in the day
# I will keep this updated as to what I do, and how I do it and the 
# launch date it happens.  As I work on this script, I want to add more features,
# Like interactive prompts to save the files. Again, I am reading a book on python, so
# I am trying to get as much experience writing as I can.
